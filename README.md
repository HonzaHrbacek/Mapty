# Mapty
WORKOUT MAPPING APPLICATION

This application locates the user's location and displays it on the map. The user can add two types of workouts (running and cycling) to the map, which differ in some of their features and display style. The application is not responsive.

In this project, I improved especially in the use of OOP, ie in working with classes, subclasses and their instances. Furthermore, I learned to use the geolocation API and the open source mapping library Leaflet.

Last but not least, in this project I learned how to work with the localStorage property of the browser.
